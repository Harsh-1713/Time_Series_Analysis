# TimeSeriesAnalysis

Time series data is a collection of variables whose values depend on time. Analyzing time-series data is trivial with Python, but with SQL, it becomes a pretty challenging task.

SQL Project Idea: Clean the data first using the data preprocessing method and make it SQL-ready. After that, complete the following tasks:

1) Create a new column sales_next to display the values of the row below a given row.

2) Create a new column sales_previous to display the values of the row above a given row.

3) Rank the data based on sales in descending order using the RANK function.

4) Show the monthly and daily sales averages.

5) Evaluate moving averages using the window functions
